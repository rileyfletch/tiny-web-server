## Starting point objectives
- Listen on a port (like 8080)
- Accept incoming HTTP GET requests
- Parse the requested path from the HTTP headers
- Look up and serve files from a local directory
- Return proper HTTP response codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found)

## Concepts to learn
- Socket programming
- HTTP protocol basics
- Request parsing
- Basic I/O with files
- Error handling

## possible future plans
Support more HTTP methods (POST, PUT, etc.)
Add request routing/endpoints
Implement basic caching
Add configuration files
Support concurrent connections
Add logging
Basic security headers
Simple templating for dynamic content
JSON API endpoints
